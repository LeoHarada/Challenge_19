# Challenge_19

## Objective
An example project, where I work at a startup company that is building a new and disruptive platform called Fintech Finder. This application allows customers to find fintech professionals from among a list of candidates, hire them, and pay them. As Fintech Finer's lead developer, I've been tasked with integrating the Ethereum blockchain network into the application in order to enable our customers to instantly pay the fintech professionals whom they hire with cryptocurrency.
